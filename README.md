# sensor-firmware
_Stefan Arentz, September 2020_

This is some very basic MicroPython based firmware for a temperature and humidity sensor based on the ESP32. This is a work in progress. It works but it is not entirely as complete or stable as I would like it to be.

The other side of this project is the [github.com/st3fan/sensor-bridge](https://github.com/st3fan/sensor-bridge) project.
